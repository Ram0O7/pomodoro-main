# Pomodoro App

## Description

The Pomodoro App is a productivity tool built using React. It helps you manage your work and break times effectively by allowing you to set a maximum work time before taking a short break.
The app features multiple themes and fonts to choose from, and it includes alerts to notify you when it's time to get back to work after a break. With advanced CSS, the app offers an attractive, responsive, and catchy design.
Additionally, this is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can install it just like any regular app.

## Features

- **Customizable Themes and Fonts:** Toggle between multiple themes and fonts to suit your preferences.
- **Break Alerts:** Receive alerts to remind you to get back to work after your break.
